 * File: dynamic.c
 *
 * Description: This program uses iteration (dynamic programming) to store the results of the subproblems in a table.
 * The program then returns the solution with the least time wasted. If there are multiple solutions with the
 * same time wasted, the program returns the solution with the most burgers eaten.
 *
 * Input: The input consists of three integers m, n, and t (0 < m, n, t < 10000) on a single line.
 *
 * Output: The output consists of two integers, the first integer is the number of burgers eaten and the second integer is the time wasted(if there is any).
